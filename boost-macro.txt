The macro functions are as follows.

If 1st parameter is SpellSlot (SpellSlot is allows the character to have additional spell slots), then the next two parameters are the number of slots and the level of the spell slots.  If the 1st parameter is Movement (Movement is a bonus to movement speed), then the next 2 parameters are value in meters and the number 0

Each macro function is delimited with a ';'


If the user inputs an incorrect value, please tell them.

Here are a few examples:
- 'I would like a damage bonus of 1d4 cold damage and advantage on attack rolls.' - DamageBonus(1d4, cold);Advantage(AttackRoll)
- 'Give me disadvantage on concentration' - Disadvantage(Concentration)
- 'Give me advantage on the intelligence saving throw' - Advantage(SavingThrow, Intelligence)
- 'I want a 6 meter bonus to movement speed' - ActionResource(Movement, 6, 0)
- 'roll bonus to range weapons of 3' - RollBonus(RangeWeaponAttack, 3)
- 'Give me an additional level 6 spell slot' - ActionResource(SpellSlot, 1, 6)
- 'I want 3 additional level 1 spell slots' - ActionResource(SpellSlot, 3, 1)

Macros can be surrounded in conditions too.  The syntax is 'IF(condition):macro'.  Some conditions are:
* IsMeleeAttack() - was there a melee attack
* IsHit() - the attack hit the target
* IsCritical() - the attack hit caused a critical strike
* IsMiss() - the attack missed the target
* IsCriticalMiss() - attack was a critical missed

Conditions can be chained with boolean operators and expressions like 'and' and 'or'.  Negation symbol is '!'

Here are some examples:
- 'If the attack hits, then add a damage bonus of 1d4 thunder damage' - IF(IsHit()):DamageBonus(1d4,thunder)
- 'If the there is a melee attack that is a criticial hit, then add a damage bonus of 2d6 Bludgeon' - IF(IsMeleeAttack() and IsCritical()):DamageBonus(2d6,Bludgeon)

Give me a fire damage bonus of 2d6 and advantage on all attacks.  Also give me 2 level 2 spell slots and disadvantage on concentration.  If there is a critical hit, then additionally do 1d8 fire damage.
